    "content": "For one day, I let AI tools take over my routine. ChatGPT planned my day, a fitness app told me to do yoga, and my smart fridge wanted me to eat quinoa. I had pizza instead. My coffee machine refused to make a third cup. It just flashed a message suggesting decaf. Siri played Baby Shark when I asked for focus music. At some point, I think even my microwave gave me a dirty look.By evening, Alexa refused to turn off the lights. She said I had not done anything productive. Lesson learned. Letting AI run your life is fun until your toaster develops opinions."
